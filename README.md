# Atlas-GPT (AI Assisted Development)
Atlas-GPT is a discord bot developed with the assitance of Chat GPT, allowing for GPT access within a discord server/channel. The bot will recall the chat it is having with a specific user during the session and can also implement the use of personas for specific use cases.

## Template Personas
